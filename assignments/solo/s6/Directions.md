# Assignment #7: Guided Recursion

This assignment is designed to help you practice using recursion.

## Task

Implement 10 recursive functions.

The descriptions of these functions are given in `recursion.py` along
with their *signatures*.

As given, these functions return a constant value so that the associated
unit tests run (unsuccessfully) without raising exceptions.

Replace those `return` statements with the necessary Python statements
to implement the described functionality.

You **must use recursion**, *no loops* (`if` statements are okay).

Suggestion: implement one function and check that its associated unit
test passes before moving on to the next function.

## Logistics

Copy the program and pytest text files to your local work area.

Modify the program file to create a working program.

You will need to have the pytest module installed.  To install pytest,
in a terminal, try

    python3 -m pip install pytest

-or-

    python3 -m pip install --user pytest

[If on debian or MacOS, use --break-system-packages at your own risk.]

Run the modified program under pytest and save the output to a file.
For example,

	pytest recursion_test.py > recursion_test.txt

You should also be able to invoke pytest like this:

    python3 run_pytest.py recursion_test.py > recursion_test.txt

Go to this assignment in [LC-CS-172-Fall-2025](https://classroom.google.com);
submit your ASCII text files.
