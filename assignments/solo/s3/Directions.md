# Assignment #3: selection sort

This assignment is designed to assess/improve your coding capabilities
by implementing an important standard algorithm using basic Python.

## Task

Implement a simple in-place stable selection sort.

* simple:
  - the algorithm is simple
  - the implementation is simple, using only basic Python

* in-place: results are computed within the data array using minimal
  extra storage 

* stable: if i < j and key[i] == key[j], then data[i] preceeds
  data[j] in the output 

    That is, don't change the relative order of key-equal elements.

## Logistics

Copy the program text file here to your local work area; modify it as
described in the Assignment Description comments within that file.

Run the modified program;
save the output to a file.

Go to this assignment in [LC-CS-172-Fall-2025](https://classroom.google.com);
submit your ASCII text files.
