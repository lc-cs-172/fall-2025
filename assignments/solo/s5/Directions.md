# Assignment #5: Eight Queens

This assignment is designed to help you explore and learn how to use
recursion.

## Task

On an 8x8 chessboard, find all the placements of 8 queens where all are
safe.

The queen, in chess, can move as far as it wants in a straight line
along unoccupied squares horizontally, vertically, or along any
diagonal.  If any two queens lie on the same line, then they are not
safe -- one can capture the other.  For example, on a 4x4 chessboard
with 4 queens

queens not safe (shown with U)

		U|.|.|.
		.|.|Q|.
		U|.|.|.
		.|.|.|U

safe placement

		.|.|Q|.
		Q|.|.|.
		.|.|.|Q
		.|Q|.|.
