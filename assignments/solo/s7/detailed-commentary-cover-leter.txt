Subject: Helpful commentary on  Assignment #8: Recursive Merge-Sort

Hello LC-CS-172-Fall-2025,

You may wonder why grading takes so long ... in part, it's because we
try to give uniform, detailed, and constructive feedback.  That takes a
lot of time.

I recently finished grading the remaining #8 assignments -- I score the
extra credit portions (and look over the entire submission) myself --
and I found the feedback I was offering to the submitters was helpful
for all of you.

All of the personally identifiable information has been removed, so
it's safe to share this feedback with the entire class, and the public
-- our class github repo (but not Google Classroom of Group) is public.

Yes, this commentary is a bit episodic, with repetition.  But yes, there
is valuable how-to-program, how-to-communicate, how-to-submit-good-work
advice in here.

I've also included some of the demo programs I worked up to make my
points in the feedback; most are enrichment, some are reinforcement for
what you should already know, none of this new demo code has new
material that will be needed the final.

I'm publishing this commentary and code to share with you things I think
you should know and that I hope you'll take with you from CS-172 as you
continue your journey.

Best,  /Joseph
