# Assignment #4: Coding and comparing various sorts

This assignment is designed to introduce you to pair programming,
experimental analysis, data visualization, and see-for-yourself that
performance claims are mostly accurate.

## Motivation and submission details

[adapted from classroom post on 17-Sep-2025]

Good news -- feedback works -- I got the message.  I know folks want
more in-class programming, interaction, and in-real-time feedback on
programming style and debugging.

I'm "flipping the classroom" this Friday -- we'll pair up, and work on a
fun project.

Each assignment will have two authors, one primary submission, and one
secondary submission. Yes, two submissions, one each (to satisfy Google
Classroom logistics).  The write-up is a single ASCII .txt file called
`compare_simple_sorts_write-up.txt`.  Each write-up contains *brief*
entries which

* identify your paired programming partner
* indicate the primary and secondary submitters
* state how you used AI if at all
* mention how you shared responsibilities
* describe what you observed
* describe what you learned

The secondary submitter should be able to just submit the common
write-up file.

You'll each get the same homework score based on the primary submission.

## Logistics

Copy the program text file here to your local work area; modify it as
described in the Assignment Description comments within that file.

Generate the required .txt and .png files.  Use the specified names.

Go to this assignment in [LC-CS-172-Fall-2025](https://classroom.google.com);
submit your files.

## Primary Submission Files

* `compare_simple_sorts_program.py`
* `compare_simple_sorts_output.txt`
* `compare_simple_sorts_wallClock.png`
* `compare_simple_sorts_compareCount.png`
* `compare_simple_sorts_exchangeCount.png`
* `compare_simple_sorts_accessCount.png` <!-- sum of comparisions + exchanges -->
* `compare_simple_sorts_write-up.txt`

## Secondary Submission Files

* `compare_simple_sorts_write-up.txt`
