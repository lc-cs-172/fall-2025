# Computer Science II

## Course Information

Lewis & Clark College, Fall 2025  
CS-172, Section 01  
Monday/Wednesday/Friday 10:20-11:20 AM  
Olin 305

**Google Classroom:** This is our primary "trailhead" for the class.  We'll use
[Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com) throughout the semester to
share assignment due dates, reminders about exams, and track your grade.  You'll
submit your work there.  You need to be logged in to your @lclark.edu address to
access it.

**Google Group:** Our
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/lclark.edu/g/25fa-cs-172-01), To:
25fa-cs-172-01@lclark.edu, is available, and might be useful for incidental
conversations and chats.  But the bulk of our class interaction will be via our
Google Classroom.  You need to be logged in to your @lclark.edu address to
access it.

**GitHub:** We'll use
[lc-cs-172/fall-2025](https://github.com/lc-cs-172/fall-2025) to share notes,
activities, and assignment details with you.  This is a one-way communication
conduit -- you don't need to use the "git" command, and you won't check anything
in there -- you can read what you need on the website with a browser.

**Pythonorama:** We'll often refer to
[Pythonorama](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama#pythonorama) for info on
class-related topics, and helpful study (and test) questions.

**Microsoft Visual Studio Code:** We'll use both interactive Python sessions and
[Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/development_tools/vs_code.md)
throughout the semester for live coding sessions.  If you have never used an
integrated developing environment (IDE), I recommend that you use this one.  It
is installed on the computers in Olin 305.  It is relatively easy to
[install](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/development_tools/vs_code.md)
on your computer. If you run into issues, talk to the instructor, the TA, or
Jorge, the lab administrator.

## Why We're Here

Lewis & Clark College is an institution of higher learning, which exists to
discover, advance, and disseminate knowledge for the common good.  That's the
college's goal, and that's a primary reason why I'm here -- to teach you, not
just tell you but *show* you, the **what** and **why** of computing and computer
science fundamentals.  But it's a shared responsibility.  I can teach you, but I
can't do the learning for you -- you have to put in the effort to participate
and to learn.

## Q1/ Why is this syllabus so long?

A1/ There's a bunch of stuff you should know and this is a good place for it.
And I started with a great base written by Prof. Alain KÃ¤gi.

## Q2/ Why is this syllabus so formal?

A2/ Clarity is a virtue, so I tried to be clear.  I'm not always this detailed.

## Class is in-Person

We are here to learn, IRL, together.  Please, come to class.  It's the best way
to learn at college, and a helpful means for me to assess your engagement and
progress.  But if you're sick, please stay home; if you feel ill during class,
please leave quietly.  Masks are welcome.  When you come to class, please be
present -- put away your phones, put away your distractions; turn your attention
to listening, learning, and *participating* in *your* educational journey.

## Course Description

CS-172, Computer Science II, is fundamentally an _introduction_ to the science
of Computer Science, exploring data structures and algorithms with analysis,
employing object-oriented programming and recursion, using Python 3.8 or better.

This course covers more sophisticated algorithms than you saw in CS-171, and
some basics of software development.  The class is taught with Python; you are
not expected to have any prior experience with Python.  But you are expected to
already know how to program in a conventional programming language.

## Course Goals

My primary goal is for us to have FUN! while learning the beauty, elegance,
importance, and practicality of computer science fundamentals, to meet each of
you where you are and help you all succeed in CS-172.  Our goals are common,
while the paths are many -- you are unique, and I appreciate, encourage, and
respect that. I'm happy to adjust my approach to facilitate your learning.  Talk
to me -- let me know what's working, and what's not working, for you.

Other coarse goals include the following.

* Teach essential programming concepts not already covered in CS-171.  These
include recursion and object-oriented programming (both composition and
inheritance).

* Cover many foundational data structures and algorithms, such as arrays, linked
lists, stacks, queues, graphs, searching, and sorting.

* Introduce techniques to analyze the performance of these data structures and
algorithms.  In particular, these techniques will give us ways to evaluate the
relative performance of various algorithms and data structures.

* Introduce software development best practices, including unit testing and
version control.

* Give you practice and feedback on writing larger, more sophisticated programs,
using functional decomposition and modularity, with an emphasis on clarity,
communication, and best programming practices.

* Help you learn how to work in a collaborative environment.  There will be pair
programming and group exercises.

This class is *not* about the nuts and bolts of programming in Python.  This
class *is* about learning _how_ to program, in general.  We use Python 3.8 or
better for our programming activities.  But the skills you'll learn and practice
in this class are applicable to most other programming languages.

This class is *not* primarily about programming, it's about problem solving
using computational capabilities.  Programming is a means to implement
techniques that work.  This class is designed to teach you the fundamental
techniques needed to solve common problems, and how to implement those solutions
accurately and efficiently.

This class *is* about applying the widely applicable and powerful techniques
of logical thinking, problem decomposition, careful observation, critical
analysis, and honest assessment.

To help you learn these skills, I may, in some activities and programming
assignments, explicitly forbid you to use some specific features of Python.

## AI policy

We're here to learn what works, how and why it works.  We're not here to
cut-and-paste some cookbook or AI generated solutions.  AI is allowed as a
resource.  Like any resource, it must be credited if used in your work.

AI generated answers or code are **not acceptable** as *your* work in this
course -- all the work you turn in must be of your own creation, with clear
citations for any references you use.  You must understand and be able to
explain what you submit.

Besides the usual caution that AI can be wrong (in my recent experience with
topics from this course, it is often wrong), please realize that using AI to do
the course work is doing yourself a disservice.  You don't learn if someone or
something is doing the work for you.  You learn by working at it, trying to
solve it yourself, having _your_ brain figure it out, and thereby making your
personal neurological connections.  Learning the fundamentals is also how you
build the ability to judge the validity of AI results.


## Learning Outcomes

The learning objectives for this class include:

0. Apply logical and quantitave reasoning to analyze and solve problems using
computer science tools and techniques.
1. Read and write code in the Python programming language, observing stylistic
conventions.
2. Design and implement object-oriented applications incorporating both new code
and existing libraries.
3. Solve computational problems using recursion.
4. Use, implement, explain, and compare various data structures and algorithms.

    Data structures may include arrays, lists, graphs, stacks, and queues.
    Implementations include array-based and reference-based versions.

5. Write unit tests.

## Office Hours, Accessibility, and Interaction

I more than hope you will visit me throughout the term, so I can learn more
about your interests, answer your questions, and we can normalize talking with
your instructors.  Office hours are _obligatory_ -- they are a key part of your
participation grade.  You may bring a friend.  No appointment is necessary to
see me during normal office hours -- but you can make an appointment to have
priority -- simply stop by Monday or Friday before class.  To setup an
appointment outside normal hours, please email me at jskudlarek@lclark.edu.

I encourage interaction, both inside and outside the classroom.  Feel free to
chat with me when we're on campus.

## Contact Methods and Timing

My preferred contact methods are in-class, office hours, and email.  I will also
be monitoring our Google Classroom.  My normal work hours are MWF between 9 AM
and 1 PM; you can expect a response from me by the end of the next class day.

## Assignments

All assignments will be announced on Google Classroom, details will be posted on
our class GitHub repo, and assignments are submitted through our Google
Classroom.  Assignments are designed to help you master and apply what we are
learning in class.  **Assignments are due on Friday at 11:59 PM of the week they
are due.** Points will be taken off when submitted late -- the Late Policy below.

Simple assignments are due in about a week.  More involved assignments will have
about 2 weeks to complete.  We'll grade and return the assignment in about a
week after it's due.

Correctness and clarity are essential, both in programs and writeups.  Coding
style matters.  A lot.  Names are especially important, so be sure to use Python
[appropriate stylistic conventions](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/style/names.md).

I automate some of the grading, so please follow the
directions with regard to file naming and file formats.

In general, all the files you submit for assignments are text files, simple
ASCII text files -- not Word documents, not Visual Studio code project files,
just simple ASCII text files.  They must be in TEXT (not BINARY) format, and
have the suffix `.txt`.  Python programs will have names like
visit_every_element.py.txt and the program's output will go into files with
names like visit_every_element.out.txt.
[We hope this works; Google Classroom has quirks we're still working out.]

Note that in Google Classroom, once an assignment is graded and returned, it
can't be resubmitted.  And in fact, once you submit the assignment, you can't
edit it (to prevent changes while it is being graded).  But it can be returned
to you without grading, and then you can edit and resubmit.

I want to encourage early submissions with few downsides; therefore, we'll
(usually) let you revise your submission if it's before the due date and we have
not yet graded it, but you'll have to ask us to return it to you ungraded first.

The files should adhere to these formatting standards:

        - keep program line length <= 120 characters
        - keep writeup and output line length <=  80 characters
		- use consistent indenting and whitespace
        - use Python specific stylistic conventions
        - prefer short focused functions that do one thing well
        - minimize global *variables* (global named constants are encouraged)
        - use helpful comments -- you don't need many; you usually need some,
          especially for important [or obscure] constants, variables, and functions

## Late Policy

Unless otherwise indicated, assignment will be accepted up to 1 week late, with
*progressive grade impact*.

days late	| submit| reduction in score
---			| ---	| ---
1 			| Mon	|	-10%
2			| Tue	|	-20%
3			| Wed	|	-30%
4			| Thu	|	-40%
5			| Fri	|	-50%
more than 5	| N/A	| no credit

Please realize that the assignments are due when they are due, even if our class
does not meet that day.  Delaying your submission also delays your learning and
delays timely feedback.

[Prof. Peter Drake's Policies](https://github.com/PeterDrake/drakepedia/blob/master/administrivia/policies.md).

## Grade Scale

I plan to use the following scale to compute your final grade.  NB: I don't
grade on a curve (i.e., Gaussian distribution) -- you each get the grade you
earn.

Grade            | Point Range
-|-
**A- or A**      | 90-100
**B-, B, or B+** | 80-89
**C or C+**      | 72-79
**C-**           | 70-71
**D+**           | 68-69
**D**            | 62-67
**F**            |  0-61

Note that I may adjust your final grade in the class up or down in light of your
participation, attendance, progress, and overall commitment to the class.

NB: This grade scale is consistent with
[L&C's grading policy](https://docs.lclark.edu/undergraduate/policiesprocedures/grading/).
The grade of `B` reflects work that is normally done thoughtfully and thoroughly
by students.  This is a good grade -- it's a fully-meets-expectations grade.
The grade of `A` is earned by students who consistently do outstanding work and
who show an unusually strong commitment to being active participants in the
learning process.


## Grading Input

There are multiple aspects to learning, and we weigh the following inputs to
assess your progress.  Like all aspects of this class, we will adjust this
policy if needed to improve effectiveness.

* Class participation: 				12 points
* Individual homework assignments: 	30 points
* Group programming assignments: 	28 points
* Exams: 							30 points

Group programming assignments will be done in pairs.

### Exams

There will be two midterms and one final exam, with weights 8/10/12.  The
midterms will have about 10 questions each; the final will have about 20
questions.  Each midterm will cover all the preceding material, the final is
comprehensive.

The exams are closed-book pen-and-paper tests given in the classroom -- No
calculators, no smart phones or watches, no computers or tablets, no notes.

Sources for exam questions include

* anything taught in class, especially if taught with emphasis

* anything in the  **required reading**  
  the notes, including demo programs (e.g., notes-nn/*{note*.md,demo*.py}),
  and any Pythonorama topic mentioned in the notes, is required reading

* any number of one-star and two-star questions from the Questions and Answers
  sections of relevant pages in
  [Pythonorama](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama#pythonorama).

* applying what was taught in class or via the required reading

## Helpful Tips

**Attend all classes.** The classroom is a place to learn new concepts,
to work through activities to reinforce learning, to engage in discussions
with your teachers and your peers, and to get your questions answered.
If you have to miss class for illness or an
emergency, please let me know and try to ask a peer to take notes for you.
Classes will start on time -- be there or be square.  Being on time for class
maximizes learning, and shows respect for our learning community.

**Collaborate with your peers.** Form a study group and get together to talk
about the class.  The sooner you get together with your peers to talk about the
class and the material, the better.  That way you can look over your notes right
away, when the concepts are still fresh.  You are likely to learn a lot from one
another and find places where you need clarification from me before exam-time.
You may collaborate on assignments, but you must submit your own work,
and credit all your sources.

**Get to know your teacher.** Please feel free to stop by early in the semester,
and stop by often.  Really.  That's **why I'm here** -- not only to answer your
questions about the lectures and the assignments, but also to engage in
conversation about computer science, software, programming, working in industry,
and other questions, big or small, that you may have.  I love interacting with
students -- you are primary participants in our shared learning.

## High-level Schedule

The following schedule is indicative, but not absolute.  It is subject to
revision based on class needs.

* W1-15: woven throughout the course:
    - basic data structures, algorithms, and analysis
    - Python programming
    - best programming practices
* W1-2:  Monolithic Main Methods
* W3-4:  Functional Decomposition
* W5-6:  Recursion
* W7-9:  Object-oriented Programming
* W10-15: More Data Structures, Algorithms, and Analysis

## Course Policies

**Attendance.**  Attendance is key to master the topics covered in this course.
Participation in discussion and activities will help gain that proficiency.
If you must miss a class for any reason, please obtain information about the
the missed class from your classmates.  Missing the midterms or final exam
disadvantages you -- make-up exams will only be given for very serious circumstances.

**Accommodations.**  Please see me if there are accommodations that could help
you learn more effectively in this class or if you are experiencing barriers to
accessibility in our class.  Some kinds of accommodations may require
documentation through the
[Office of Student Accessibility](https://www.lclark.edu/offices/student-accessibility/).
If you plan to take exams in the Office of Student Accessibility, please
schedule with them and let me know well in advance of the exam.

**Course Add/Drop and Withdrawals.** You may drop this course on WebAdvisor by
Friday of the second week of class (Fri 12-Sep-2025) and no W grade will appear
on your transcript.  After the second week and before 4 PM on Friday of the 10th
week, you can withdraw from the course by submitting a Course Withdrawal form to
the Registrar's Office.  In this case, a W grade will appear on your transcript.

**The last day to withdraw from this class is Fri 07-Nov-2025** It is not
possible for me to authorize your withdrawal from the course after that date.
At that point, you will need to complete the course and take whatever grade you
have earned.  If you have questions or concerns about your performance in the
course, please talk with me well before Friday 07-Nov-2025.

**Academic Integrity.** Academic integrity is an essential part of ethical and
high quality learning and scholarship. Integrity failures (e.g., plagiarism,
cheating, the deliberate misrepresentation of information) are reason enough to
**fail** this course. Period.

Again, we're not here to have you cut-and-paste ML output and claim it as your
own -- doing so is plainly wrong, it is antithetical to responsible scholarship
and learning, and is unacceptable.

Please avoid any behavior that may be reasonably viewed as suspicious. Remember
that helping a classmate to cheat counts as cheating.  You need to cite all your
sources.  If you have any questions about the use of generative AI technology
(e.g., ChatGPT) or plagiarism boundaries or about what type of material you can
access while working on an assignment, please see me before you turn in your
work.  If you have any questions or concerns about academic honesty, please come
see me or refer to Lewis & Clark's
[Academic Integrity Policy](https://docs.lclark.edu/undergraduate/policiesprocedures/academicintegrity/).

**Other.** All college policies govern this course.  Please see the
[Undergraduate Catalog](https://college.lclark.edu/catalog/) for related issues
not covered in this syllabus.

## Tutoring

**SQRC** The SQRC is an informal and free drop-in peer tutoring center.  The
SQRC offers in-person tutoring in JR Howard 134 (across from Watzek Library).
It is open from 10 AM-10 PM Monday-Thursday, with limited hours on Friday and
Sunday, closed on Saturday.  If you need help with this class, in addition to
office hourse, check the SQRC
[website](https://college.lclark.edu/departments/mathematical_sciences/sqrc/)
for the availability of tutors assigned to this class; or just come on by! No
appointment needed.

**SAAB**
[SAAB tutoring](https://college.lclark.edu/academics/support/saab-tutoring/)
will also be available.  One-on-one peer tutors are available for a range of
courses across departments.  Request to be connected with a SAAB tutor if
needed.  Students are eligible to receive two hours of tutoring per course each
week.

## L&C CS Resource

[**Pythonorama**](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama#pythonorama)
contains summaries of topics covered in L&C CS classes.  I'll draw some exam
questions from the Questions and Answers sections found at the end of most
pages.
