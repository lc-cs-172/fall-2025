### Extra Credit (syllabus updated)

* Most assignments will have extra credit portions, clearly identified.  
* It's extra credit -- you don't need to do it.  
* It's extra effort -- for both of us.  
* To keep the effort manageable, it's a package deal with modest feedback.  
* If you attempt it, and do it well, there is extra credit.  
* If you attempt it, and don't do it well, there's little to no extra credit.
