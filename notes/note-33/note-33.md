# LC-CS-172 Lesson Plan for Mon 24-Nov-2025

## Today's Hot Topics

* non-standard tree depth definition
* final
* assignment: simulate segregation w/ live-coding
* simple graphics
* get the demo to run -- install graphics.py

## administrivia

* please mark your attendance in Google Classroom for today

## tree depth

* NB: The *standard* definition of tree depth (sometimes called tree height) is
  the length of the longest path from root to leaf measured in **EDGE** count.

* For coding simplicity and easy estimation, I was *sloppy* and used node count,
  not edge count.
