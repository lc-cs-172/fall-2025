* please mark your attendance in Google Classroom for today

* when you come see me for office hours

  + please submit the date in the Google Classroom assignment

## Hey is for Horses (as my dad used to say)

I'm pretty relaxed about how you pronounce my last name, and calling me
"Joseph" is fine  
... and "Professor" is an honorific fantasy for me ...

But I realize email starting with "Hey Joseph" or "Hey Prof" is a bit
too casual for *my* comfort.

Nobody does that, other than old friends I've known for many years.  
So,
please, let's go with "Hello" or "Hi", but not "Hey".

## Office Hours -- Walk-in and by Appointment

* if walk-in office hours, do drop in; you can also make an appointment

otherwise

* you need to *get it on my calendar* and **send** me a calendar invite,  
  with **at least 2 hours notice**, and ensure I accept it;  
  or I won't know about it, I'll think it's not happening, and I won't be there.

  This has happened at least twice so far.  Again, you need to get it on
  my calendar.

## Delayed Response?

  Recall that I only teach part-time MWF in the morning.  
  My stated goal is to return emails before the end of the next class day.  
  That's class day, not calendar day,  
  so we skip Tue, Thu, Sat, Sun, holidays, and breaks.

## Post-it Note Protocol

We're doing in-class active feedback today  
-- grab a red and green Post-it Note --  
you know what to do (refer to note-02).

### miscellaneous feedback topics

* stretching vs. asking questions  
  - a misunderstanding -- Tsibo was just stretching
  - if a question to a question, use the two handed protocol

* clean code and live coding

  We still have one outstanding assignment #2.

  When it's turned in, I'll review with you what I wrote  
  and why I consider it clean code, what I look for, how I review code.

  Design reviews and code reviews are important practices in industry.  
  Great way to get good code; and a great way to learn how to program.

## Provide Detailed Study Guide?

You have

  - written notes
  - demo programs
  - Pythonorama
  - your notes

Q/ Will I provide more than that?

A/ Nope.

  As mentioned, I'm teaching a class, not writing a textbook (cf. note-04).  
  I'm also not writing Cliff Notes for this course.

  - [Royal Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Road)

		  Euclid is said to have replied to King Ptolemy's request for an
		  easier way of learning mathematics that "there is no Royal Road
		  to geometry", according to Proclus.[8] The same sentence is also
		  attributed to Menaechmus replying to Alexander the Great.[9]

  And there is no Royal Road to Computer Science.

## Python Machinery (mention w/ pointers)

[Pythonorama variables](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/data_structures/variables.md)  
[Pythonorama strings](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/data_structures/strings.md)  
[Pythonorama references](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/data_structures/references.md)  
[Pythonorama if_else](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/control_structures/if_else.md)  
[Pythonorama loops](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/control_structures/loops.md)

## Basic Simple Searches (review)

* linear search
* binary search

[Pythonorama search](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/algorithms/search.md)

## Basic Simple Sorts (review)

* in-place
* stable
* selection sort
* insertion sort  
  I overlooked an important detail -- I'll explain in class
* bubble sort  
  bubble sort is an *anti-pattern* -- don't do it!  

		An [anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern)
		is a solution to a class of problem which may be commonly used
		but is likely to be ineffective or counterproductive.

## Execution Performance (speed and space)

* It depends, actually.

* Your milage may vary.

## Wikipedia is Misleading about Insertion Sort

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) claims

		More efficient in practice than most other simple quadratic
		algorithms such as selection sort or bubble sort

I'll explain in class.

## Python Collections

* collections hold references

* mutable and immutable

* tuples  
  [Pythonorama tuples](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/data_structures/tuples.md)

#### [[we got to about here]]

* lists  
  [Pythonorama lists](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/data_structures/lists.md)
  - collections hold references  
     => things can change inside a list
  - deep vs. shallow copies  
    timing selection sort required copy of input!

* dictionaries

* sets  
  [Pythonorama sets](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/data_structures/sets.md)


## Python List Comprehension

    To be added later -- i.e., To Be Determined (TBD)

## A Bit about Computing Machinery

* hardware circuits and boolean logic
* hardware architecture
  - cpu: ALU and registers
  - physical memory
    + register
	+ cache
	+ main
  - I/O (terminal+disk+network)
  - virtual memory
    + paging
	+ swapping
* microcode and firmware
* operating system (kernel+root+user)
* platform/ecosystem
* compilers and linkers and loaders
* interpreters
