# LC-CS-172 Topics for Mon 20-Oct-2025

## Points to Ponder

### Don't fool your intuition

* solve the problem the way you understand it
  - w/ 8Q, use a 2D board if that's how you think about it

* variable and function names should be and do what they say

## Today's Hot Topics

* feedback
* correction re: local variable behavior
* more **Object Oriented Programming**
* Linked Lists

## Administrivia

* please mark your attendance in Google Classroom for today

* 2 assignments (solo/s5 and solo/s6) were extended, are both due **today**

* I'll assign new assignment (solo/s7) later today, will be due in 1 week

* Physics Colloquium today

        The Joy of Researching the Sports World
		by John Eric Goff, Physics Dept. Univ. of Puget Sound
        Monday, Oct. 20 at 4pm in Olin 204

* Anyone not able to run pytest?  If so, let's fix that.

## Feedback

I love getting polite feedback that's news I can use  
-- as anonymously requested (feedback note left at front of room),  
I will be providing extra credit options with every new assignment.

## Correction re: local variable

* Python does *some* static analysis:
  - if a variable *might* be assigned within a function, it is made local

  [demo local variables](demo_local_variable.py)

## Review

* recursion and eight queens
* O(n*n) means *eventually* n*n beats linear and constant terms  
  [demo asymptotic growth rates](demo_domination_eventually.py)

## Object Oriented Programming in Python (continued)

OOP is a ***fundamental technique*** -- it is an essential tool in your programming toolbox.

### The Big Idea -- applied to Linked Lists

[demo linked list](demo_linked_list.py)  
[demo linked list test](demo_linked_list_test.py)

* You can define your own **Type** of *Object*
  - You can define what it does
  - You can define how it does it
* You can create Objects of that Type
* OOP enables wonderful modularity
* OOP enables powerful abstraction/isolation
  - the interface says what the Type does
  - how it does it is up to the Type's implementation
* Objects can self-manage (think *modularity*)
* Objects can depend on other Objects
  - via inheritance (*is-a*)
  - via composition (*has-a*)
  - via interface (*like-a*)

## Live-coding

* work on any CS-172 assignment you want
* ask your classmates for help if you wish
* please help your classmates if they ask
