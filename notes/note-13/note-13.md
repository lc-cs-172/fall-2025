# LC-CS-172 Outline for Fri 03-Oct-2025

## Administrivia

* please mark your attendance in Google Classroom for today

* Fall Break next week -- no class on Fri 10-Oct-2025

* Homework -- you have *two* solo assignments, both due in *two* weeks.
  - Assigned today: 	../../assignments/solo/s5 -- eight-queens
  - Assigned on Monday: guided practice with recursion and pytest

## Points to Ponder

* please do the assignment as specified
  - don't make (presumed) optimizations
  - we're often trying to make a point

* classic bubble sort is classic bubble sort
  - claimed optimizations often aren't
  - early termination for random input isn't!

* don't be too clever
  - where have we heard that before?
  - "improving classic code" industry story

* please do the assignment as specified
  - **replace** the *placeholder* code **with your** code
  - remove the placeholder code -- all of it
  - supply your working CLEAN code in its place

* AI gets it wrong

## Midterm-1

* return today
* review next class period -- bring you questions
  
## Feedback and Response

* more in-class hands-on and live-coding
  - already underway
* more Python-focused explanations and practice
  - change in heading underway
* *only* test after guided practice
  - not how this course works
  - this is not a turn-the-crank course
  - that is not how life works

## Lecture: action-at-a-distance
