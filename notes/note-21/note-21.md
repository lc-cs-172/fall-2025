#### required reading

* [Pythonorama OOP classes](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/oop/classes.md)
* [Pythonorama OOP methods](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/oop/methods.md)

## Stacks/Queues/Deques

* stack: aka push-down stack
  - single ended
  - push
  - pop
  - LIFO -- last-in, first-out

    - id(), **new**: `is`, `==`
  - when and how to make a copy
  - function definitions
  - unit testing, including pytest
  - Big-O notation
