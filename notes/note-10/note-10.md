## Feedback

### I wish you wouldn't change the assignment mid-week

The feedback was stated very politely, which I greatly appreciate, but
I'm a tad unsure I understood it correctly, since, in fact, I didn't
change the assignment.

It's still the original assignment -- create 3 instrumented sorts, drop
'em into the test harness, adjust 2 constants and run to get reliable
results, then write-up what you observed, and describe what you learned.

I did improve the test harness and the description as the week
progressed, but it's still the same assignment.
